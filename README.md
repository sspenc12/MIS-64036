# MIS-64036
Repository dedicated to coursework and projects for MIS-64036: Business Analytics.

Assignment #1:

The topics of this assignment were reviewing descriptive statistics, normal distributions, and data wrangling in R. The assignment included manual calculations of the z-scores, probabilities in different scenarios, and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Additionally the data wrangling focused on a shopping data set of 540,000 entries. The "dplyr" package was utilized to review the data set, as well as manipulation of the POSIXIt and POSIXct objects. The goal was to determine business insights and answers to various questions from the data set.


Assignment #2:

The topics of this assignment focused on additional functions within RStudio. This included creating linear regression models and verifying all four of the assumptions are met for a regression modeling. From the models we determined the amount of variability captured by certain variables, as well as reviewing reviewing the residuals from the model. The residuals were analyzed to determine if they were normal and if any patterns still exist in the remaining data. Additional examples looked at the "mtcars" and "bostonhousing" data sets to create linear models and running ANOVA analyses to determined variable importance.
