# MIS-64036
Repository dedicated to coursework and projects for MIS-64036: Business Analytics.

Assignment #1:

The topics of this assignment were reviewing descriptive statistics, normal distributions, and data wrangling in R. The assignment included manual calculations of the z-scores, probabilities in different scenarios, and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Additionally the data wrangling focused on a shopping data set of 540,000 entries. The "dplyr" package was utilized to review the data set, as well as manipulation of the POSIXIt and POSIXct objects. The goal was to determine business insights and answers to various questions from the data set.


Assignment #2:

The topics of this assignment focused on additional functions within RStudio. This included creating linear regression models and verifying all four of the assumptions are met for a regression modeling. From the models we determined the amount of variability captured by certain variables, as well as reviewing reviewing the residuals from the model. The residuals were analyzed to determine if they were normal and if any patterns still exist in the remaining data. Additional examples looked at the "mtcars" and "bostonhousing" data sets to create linear models and running ANOVA analyses to determined variable importance.

Group Project:

The objective of the group project was to create a logistic regression model to predict how likely a customer is to churn at a cellular phone service company. The data set contained 19 predictor variables and just over 3,000 tuples to review. This involved cleaning and treating the data for missing values, negative values, and normality/skewness before creating a model. Feature engineering was also utilized to improve the accuracy of the model. Once the model was created from the training data, it was verified against the test data with AUC measurements. Lastly, insights were gathered from the results and presented to the class along with our recommendations to prevent customers from churning.
